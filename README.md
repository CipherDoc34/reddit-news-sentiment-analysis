# Reddit News - Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis
## Goals
Be able to read reddit posts and comments to gain an insight into how the reddit population feels about certain issues.
Using multiple forms of sentiment analysis and emotion detection (nlp) techniques form an overall picuture about an audiences reation about a subject.
## In-Progress
Currently starting with the r/Politics subreddit and collecting the news stories that users are posting to form an image of the way the current political rivalry is being presented in the media.

## Pivots
Originally wanted to use Twitter/X posts and comments to gain a more fine-grained overview of users' outlook on certain issues, however the Twitter data is guarded behind a hefty paywall. Pivoted to Reddit as the data can be scraped.
